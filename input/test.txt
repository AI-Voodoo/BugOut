Following a series of uncontrollable fires, thousands of homes have been reduced to ashes in California. Thousands of Americans have found themselves without a roof over their heads… some won't even be able to count on their insurance.

Since January 7, the chic Pacific Palisades neighborhood, north of Los Angeles, has been ravaged by flames. Sumptuous villas, some of which belong to famous people, have been reduced to ashes, forcing residents to turn to their insurance companies.

California is facing the most devastating fires in history. The fires broke out in several Californian cities, including Altadena, Malibu and Pasadena. Faced with the scale of the situation, the governor very quickly declared a state of emergency, forcing residents to evacuate the premises. On January 10, the fires continue their destructive streak in the City of Angels, where 10 victims have been reported.

Insurance companies gradually withdrawing

According to the authorities, nearly 9,000 homes and buildings have been completely destroyed. The question arises: will victims be supported by their insurance?

Le Parisien, a French daily newspaper, looked into the matter and according to its information, many homes located in Los Angeles, threatened by the fires or already gone up in smoke, are not insured. In short, the owners, victims of these uncontrollable fires, won't be able to be compensated, and won't receive any financial assistance.
